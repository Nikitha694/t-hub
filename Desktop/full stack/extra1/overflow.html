                <p>It was the shortest Test match in history in terms of balls bowled –- 642 or 107 overs -– to end in an outright result.

                    The previous shortest Test also involved South Africa, who were beaten by Australia in 656 balls in Melbourne in 1932.
                    
                    The victory was set up by man of the match Mohammed Siraj, who took six for 15 in the first innings as South Africa were skittled for 55 before lunch on the first day.
                    Apart from Markram, who hit 106 off 103 balls in South Africa's second innings of 176, batsmen struggled throughout the match on a pitch with pace, seam movement and uneven bounce.
                    
                    "Even though the conditions were tough for the batters the bowlers still had to get the ball in the right areas," said Sharma.
                    
                    "We batted well to get a hundred run lead. We knew it was going to be a short match and every run mattered. To get that lead was very important for us. </p>
